Wordpress Sinatra API
==============

**Work in progress...**

A Wordpress API using Sinatra and a DataMapper wrapper around the Wordpress database delirium. 
The DataMapper models can be used outside the API, if you'd like to have a Ruby hook around a 
Wordpress database.

The API currently supports only GET requests (reads).

## Development

Launch with ``rerun rackup``.
